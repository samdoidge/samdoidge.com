title: "Sass Lint Visual Studio Code Extension"
tags: [tech]
---

This is a great Visual Studio Code extension I found when looking to tidy up my SCSS files. It will notify you of incorrect property order, alert you when you should use variables, and much more.

You will need to install the `<a href="https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint">sass-lint</a>` NPM package with the following command `npm install -g sass-lint`. The extension should then automatically detect this. Find it under `Sass Lint` within Visual Code Extensions (Command + Ctrl + x to bring up).

To configure the rules Sass Lint uses, you can create a `.sass-lint.yml` file within the root of your project. More details are on the `sass-lint` GitHub page.
