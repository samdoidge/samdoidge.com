**2014:** Posterous is now dead, I'm using Jekyll

I’ve come back to the blog world and had to choose a platform to write my words. For me the choice was WordPress.

### Tumblr ###

They have really carved their own space in the blogging world by trimming down the traditional blog and growing a youthful user base. Tumbler makes posting a joy and sharing other peoples posts is easy. Where it falls down for me is in the SEO department, and in a big way (I have test with new blogs and low ranking key words on 2 occasions). If you want people to be primarily finding your site via search engines – Tumblr is not the platform to choose.

### Posterous ###

My last personal site used Posterous, and it was good. Everything is stored in the cloud – like Tumblr and posting is as simple as Tumblr. It wasn’t the choice for me this time due to the limited theming options and WordPress having better SEO.

### WordPress.org ###

WordPress may seem bloated compared to Tumblr and Posterous for simple blogging, but it doesn’t have to be. If you use a minimal theme – or edit one yourself – you really have the best control over your blog, strong SEO benefits and with the W3 cache plugin you can have speed as well.
