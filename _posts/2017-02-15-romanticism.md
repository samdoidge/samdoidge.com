I've had a reminder to post the following image for ages, and now I've been putting into practise the lessons from The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - I thought I should post.

Asher Durand, The Beeches, 1845.

I discovered it when viewing Romanticism art, something which seems to appeal to me - a genre almost made for me. 

The painting portrays a beautiful natural setting which seems to inherently appeal to humans, or me at least. The man is heading towards the more brightly lit area, and I think this is common to in Romanticism - heading towards something better.
