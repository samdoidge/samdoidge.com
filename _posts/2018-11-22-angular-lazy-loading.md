This is a quick video of lazy loading working for Angular 6 routes. It is used when routing to feature modules, and stops the modules being initialised before they are needed.

```const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'customers',
    loadChildren: './customers/customers.module#CustomersModule'
  }
  ]```

Is how a lazy loaded `CustomersModule` would look - the key is the loadChildren, and a the path to the to the feature module you want to lazy loaded being entered as a string.
