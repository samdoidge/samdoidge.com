Another new design.


I'm placing the Italian farm/fields image below as a monument to my last design. This is actually an old design of mine, as seen on the [Internet Archive](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20120415203312/samdoidge.com).

### Remaining tasks

There are several tasks remaining for the new design:

*  ~~Fix blockquote display.~~

* Update code highlighting on older posts.

* Make mobile friendly.

* Improve homepage post listing / post navigation.

* Introduce / unhide categories in sidebar.

* Clean up CSS.

* Make the love hearts do something :D.

* Package theme as a gem for others to use.
