I get asked a lot of questions (I don't ). Here's a how-to on SSL with Cloudflare (they now provide this on their free plan):

If you are only using Flexible SSL (HTTPS between Cloudflare and end user) you do not want a redirect in htaccess / vhosts of your site - or you will get an infinite redirect issue. So how to force people to use HTTPS? Flexible SSL is the solution, combined with a catch all Page Rule.

Goto the Page Rule section:
