This post is probably a marker that I have to split my personal and technical posts, but onwards.

My recent holiday has been a revelation to me, and I'm feeling very positive.

*Asher Durand, The Beeches, 1845.*

I discovered it when viewing Romanticism art, and it appears to be a genre almost made for me.

The painting portrays a beautiful natural setting which seems to inherently appeal to humans, or me at least. The man is heading towards the more brightly lit area, and I think this is common in Romanticism - heading towards something better.
