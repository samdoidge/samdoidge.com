I used to browse a blog full of graphs and charts ([Jesse's Café Américain](http://jessescrossroadscafe.blogspot.co.uk)), but on the periphery were old posters and advertisements of a bygone era. I think this added something to the website. It brought some humanity - we are humans, after all.. and depending on our tastes, can appreciate such things.

I'm showing a couple of paintings I've found visually pleasing, again from the Romanticism category.
