This title pays homage to the brilliant <a href="http://peepshow.wikia.com/wiki/Conference">Peep Show</a>.

This is a project me and a friend, Ben, have been working on. We're using React Native and Typescript to have just one codebase we can quickly create tests in, and also develop for mobile from.

'Football Club Chairman' will probably be the release title - we have a UI to do and a few features to add / clean up, but it should be a fun game with much room for expansion. If you like football simulation games, or football in general, you might like this!
