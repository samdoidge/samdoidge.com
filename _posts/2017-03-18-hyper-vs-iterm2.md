I recently saw a colleague using a shiny new terminal called [Hyper](https://hyper.is/). I liked the beautiful look, and the number of GitHub Stars - so I installed, and Googled comparisons.

While it is nice to look at, installed fonts are still an issue (not much of one) but the reason I am not using it is speed / performance. This was a negative highlighted in [comparisons](https://www.slant.co/topics/525/versus/~iterm2_vs_terminal-app_vs_hyper) - so I ran a recursive ```grep``` across thousands of files. Hyper proceeded to lock-up - I had to force quit the program. iTerm2 ran the search without issue, and I was able to exit out of the search within the terminal at any point. This made it an easy decision for me - iTerm2.
