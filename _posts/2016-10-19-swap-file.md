title: 'Digital Ocean Swap File'
description: 'Swap file on Digital Ocean - can overcome the issue of your droplet killing the composer update killing process due to lack of memory.'

Digital Ocean is a great service, but by default no swap file is set on their droplets.

I first realised this issue when my droplet was killing my `composer update` process. This can lead you to thinking you need a more powerful Droplet, but simply enabling a swap file will overcome this memory issue. I will link to a guide on their server as it worked for me, and hope it doesn't break: [How To Add Swap Space on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04)
