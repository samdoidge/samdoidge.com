Rather than write a time-consuming post, I thought I would try a video. I've gone with a screen-cast, and despite having to do this twice as the Quicktime recording alerted me nothing had been recorded at the end, I think it was a lot easier than a long post. This is the solution I've reached with Laradock, and it's quick and easy:



<p style="text-align: center">
	<div class='embed-container'><iframe  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQfACQufFnE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	</div>
</p>

I will try more of these in future.

Useful command to stop all docker containers: ```docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)```.
