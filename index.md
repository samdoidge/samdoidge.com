My current focus is exploring what comes from within, rather than what is imposed externally. What are we, without our conditioning? 


<!-- Currently I'm seeking truth, wherever it may be found. -->

Recently I've worked on Property Wisdom, a site providing key data such as rental demands and yields across the UK property market. I've also contracted at a UK investment fund, and before that developed a football simulation game enjoyed by thousands. In a past life I developed a Bitcoin investment application, and worked at a cryptocurrency startup.
