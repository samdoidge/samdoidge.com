I"Z<p>Digital Ocean is a great service, but by default no swap file is set on their droplets.</p>

<p>I first realised this issue when my droplet was killing my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">composer update</code> process. This can lead you to thinking you need a more powerful Droplet, but simply enabling a swap file will overcome this memory issue. I will link to a guide on their server as it worked for me, and hope it doesnâ€™t break: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04">How To Add Swap Space on Ubuntu 16.04</a></p>
