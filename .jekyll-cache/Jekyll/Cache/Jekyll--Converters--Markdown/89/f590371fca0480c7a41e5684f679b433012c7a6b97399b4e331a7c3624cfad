I"ª<p>I used to browse a blog full of graphs and charts (<a href="http://jessescrossroadscafe.blogspot.co.uk">Jesseâ€™s CafÃ© AmÃ©ricain</a>), but on the periphery were old posters and advertisements of a bygone era. I think this added something to the website. It brought some humanity - we are humans, after all.. and depending on our tastes, can appreciate such things.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m showing a couple of paintings Iâ€™ve found visually pleasing, again from the Romanticism category.</p>
