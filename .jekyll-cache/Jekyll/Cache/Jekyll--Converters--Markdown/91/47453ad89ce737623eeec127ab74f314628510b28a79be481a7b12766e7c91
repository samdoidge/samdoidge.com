I"÷<p>Iâ€™m now using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> - a tool which transforms your markdown into static html.</p>

<p>Following a great tutorial from <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">Joshua Landa</a> I was able to setup site relatively pain free (<strong>This is a lie.</strong> On OS X Lion I had a nightmare even installing Jekyll - a minimum requirement of ruby version 1.9.2 for some library was not simple to resolve. A guide suggested uninstalling Xcode temporarily as part of a solution update ruby.. I decided it was time to update my OS - hello Mavericks.)</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve kept the site simple and expanded on some of Joshuaâ€™s and Pooleâ€™s design to brand my site, but of course keeping it simple. I had initially held off from looking into Jeykll - I had Wordpress, and a nice plugin - wp-svbtle to go along with it, but seeing a clean template to start with, Github hosting at satisfying speeds, and people able to make pull requests to my site has swayed me.</p>

<p>One thing I got wrong initially was the branch names. From looking at another tutorial I used â€˜gh-pagesâ€™ - a user Github page such as this needs the master branch. Combined with the time it takes for a Jekyll github page to be processed (10~ min delay) it can be tricky to spot.</p>

<p>For my URLs I have chosen title names - you set this by changing the permalink value to <code>"/:title"</code>, you can see this in my <a href="https://github.com/samdoidge/samdoidge.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml">config file</a>. You will need to set your pages URL if using this method - in example I had added <code>permalink: about/</code> at the top of my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samdoidge/samdoidge.github.io/master/about.md">about page</a>.</p>
