I"K<p>My friend Neil mentioned the claim ‘Fraser Island has more sand than the Sahara desert’ when viewing footage of Fraser Island tonight, it sounded almost unbelievable.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/fraser-island.jpg" alt="no-margin" /></p>

<p>Googling the claim, several results came up. Two Australian tourist sites stating this is a myth, while 2 tourist blogs recite the claim however there was no evidence presented.</p>

<p>More Googling and some back-of-the-envelope calculations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Sahara desert has an area of over 9,400,000 km<sup>2</sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Around 20% of the Sahara is covered by sand</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(9400000 / 100) * 20 = 1,880,000 km<sup>2</sup> Sahara sand area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fraser Island area is 1,840 km<sup>2</sup> total. 1,880,000 / 1,840 = 1021.73~</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One estimate gives the average depth of the Sahara sand to be approximately 150 metres.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Sahara Desert’s sand area is over 1000 times large than Fraser island and for Fraser Island to have more sand would have to be over (1000~ * 150m) 150km deep.</p>

<p>Continental crust is around 50km thick. I realise these are rough figures but I think I can say Fraser Island does not have more sand than the Sahara desert.</p>

<p><b>Myth Busted.</b></p>
