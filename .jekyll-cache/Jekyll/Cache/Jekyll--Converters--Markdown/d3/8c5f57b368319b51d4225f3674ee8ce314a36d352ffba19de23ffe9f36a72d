I"—<p>Fifa Trader connects to Fifa 13â€²s unpublished API to allow automated bidding and selling of Ultimate Team cards. Connection to FIFA servers possible from work done by numerous others on GitGub, my GitHub fork contains a current working app for ps3 accounts: <a href="https://github.com/samdoidge/FIFA13-Ultimate-Team-Search">https://github.com/samdoidge/FIFA13-Ultimate-Team-Search</a>.</p>

<p>Search screen once logged in. Twitter Bootstrap is used for the UI, third party graphics used to present data in a nice way:

Adding to a buy list will cause a CRON script to be ran several times a minute searching for target cards. Once a bid has been place it will keep checking bidding if that card is still the lowest priced available within a few minutes left of the auction.</p>

Lists current and recent transactions.</p>

<p>I have had several hundred registrations, all stumbling upon the site with no marketing - <a href="http://fifatrader.com">Fifa Trader</a></p>
