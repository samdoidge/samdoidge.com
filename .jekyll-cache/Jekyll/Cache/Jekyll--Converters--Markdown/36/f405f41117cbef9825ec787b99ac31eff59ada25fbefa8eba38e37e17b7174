I" <p>Rather than write a time-consuming post, I thought I would try a video. I’ve gone with a screen-cast, and despite having to do this twice as the Quicktime recording alerted me nothing had been recorded at the end, I think it was a lot easier than a long post. This is the solution I’ve reached with Laradock, and it’s quick and easy:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
	<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQfACQufFnE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
	</div>
</p>

<p>I will try more of these in future.

<p>Useful command to stop all docker containers: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)</code>.</p>
