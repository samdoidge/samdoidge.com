<p>Iâ€™m currently working on <a href="https://propertywisdom.io">PropertyWisdom</a> - a site providing key data to help people make the best investments in the UK property market.</p>

<p>Previous I was contracting at a UK investment fund, and before that developing a <a href="/football-club-owner">football simulation game</a> for the App Store. I have also developed a Bitcoin investment application, and worked at a cryptocurrency startup.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to think of ideas and execute them. I continually look to learn and I try not to impose limits on myself.</p>

<p>Outside of the internet some of my interests include: playing football, rowing (now only in the gym), design and reading.</p>
