I like to think of ideas and execute them. I continually look to learn and I try not to impose limits on myself.

I'm currently working on <a href="https://propertywisdom.io">Property Wisdom</a> - a site providing key data to help people make the best investments in the UK property market.

Previous I was contracting at a UK investment fund, and before that developing a [football simulation game](/football-club-owner) for the App Store. I have also developed a Bitcoin investment application, and worked at a cryptocurrency startup.

Outside of the internet some of my interests include: playing football, cycling, design and reading.

### Projects

- [Football Club Owner](/football-club-owner) - An iOS app now on the App Store. It's a football management game with some unique elements, such as player rarities. It features the creation of an extensive match engine which gives realistic scores, taking into account each players ability rating. This was built with React Native, Typescript, Realm for storage, and Mocha for tests.

- [contentlord.com](https://samdoidge.com/content-lord-instagram-posts-from-slack) - A stream of content is fed from social websites and posted to social media platforms. A Slack integration allows for curation - the user can choose to post or ignore the content. Currently supports posting to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Powers [Bitcoin Memes](https://www.instagram.com/bitcoinmemes).
