I can be emailed via the link above, at `sam@samdoidge.com`.

I'm currently working on <a href="https://propertywisdom.io">PropertyWisdom</a> - a site providing key data to help people make the best investments in the UK property market.

Previous I was contracting at a UK investment fund, and before that developing a [football simulation game](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/football-club-owner/id1460395593) for the App Store. I have also developed a Bitcoin investment application, and worked at a cryptocurrency startup. 

In my free time I like to think of ideas and execute them. I continually look to learn and I try not to impose limits on myself.

Outside of the internet some of my interests include: playing football, rowing (now only in the gym), design and reading.

### Personal projects

- [Football Club Owner](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/football-club-owner/id1460395593) - An iOS app now on the App Store. It's a football management game with some unique elements, such as player rarities. It features the creation of an extensive match engine which gives realistic scores, taking into account each players ability rating. This was built with React Native, Typescript, Realm for storage, and Mocha for tests.
